At UNM, he held joint appointments in Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Cinematic Arts and was the founding director of the Art, Research, Technology, and Science Laboratory (ARTS Lab), a unique interdisciplinary center with educational, research, and economic development activities that span the range of digital media.
</p>
<p>
Ed's textbook, Interactive Computer Graphics, with Dave Shreiner is now in its seventh edition. Ed and Dave thought that they were done with the textbook after the sixth edition but were both so intrigued with WebGL and its potential for teaching computer graphics that they did a seventh edition using WebGL exclusively. Ed has taught over 100 professional short courses, including WebGL courses at both SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia.

Lead Graphics Engineer, Floored, Inc.

<p>
Nicholas (Rhode Island School of Design, BFA, Printmaking) spent his previous life getting poisoned by antique photographic chemistry, and arguing that video games are art. One fateful day, while dehydrated in the perilous jungles of New Hampshire, he came across an outcropping. "Water!" he exclaimed. Making haste, he dived in. But this wasn't water at all - it was an ocean of hungry triangles. Before he knew it, he was fully consumed. Some time later, he was spotted on the alabaster dunes of New York City, mumbling a single phrase: "Draw teapots." And so he did. He is currently at Floored, Inc, responsible for the core rendering technologies in their in-house engine: Luma.

Cedric is the co-founder and CTO of Sketchfab — a platform for sharing 3D
content online. A veteran of the game industry since 2001, he transitioned
from a project leader in 3D client technology to launching his career as a
freelance developer in 2008. Cedric's personal and freelance projects
quickly led him to become a pioneer in WebGL technology. He developed
OSG.JS — a framework implementing an OpenScenGraph-like toolbox to interact
with WebGL via JavaScript. Using this technology, he focused on the creation
of a real-time, online 3D viewer. Cedric's innovation was quickly embraced
by the 3D community and morphed into Sketchfab — a TechStars alum and
venture-capital backed company with over 15 employees in their New York and
Paris offices.
